    <p>Session 7 - Internet Fundamentals/Security
Activity 1: Practice web browser safety.
        Activity 1: Browser Security Check
In this activity, I learned about browser privacy settings for Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. I ensured my browsers were updated, disabled unnecessary add-ons, cleared cache, and managed autoform settings. Verified certificate information on a secure website and experimented with private browsing for enhanced anonymity.
        In this activity, I will be able to apply browser security measures to enhance cybersecurity in my current work environment. Regularly reviewing and updating browser settings, keeping software updated, and managing add-ons will protect sensitive information and reduce the risk of cyberattacks. How? By maintaining privacy and safeguarding work-related data.
           Activity 2: Use anti-malware software to scan your system and test malware detection.
         In this activity, I learned about antivirus software by reviewing Wikipedia's Comparison of antivirus software. I downloaded a reputable anti-malware application to scan my system for threats. Additionally, I learned about the EICAR test file and how to use it to test and remove malware with my anti-malware application.
        In this activity, I will be able to apply knowledge of antivirus software and EICAR test files to enhance cybersecurity measures in my daily work environment. By incorporating regular system scans, staying informed on software updates, testing security measures, providing employee training, and implementing policies, I can safeguard sensitive data and mitigate risks effectively.
