    <h3 style=" color:linen;text-align:center;margin-left:20px;">Session 5b- Internet Fundamentals/ Communications</h3>
    <p style=" color:linen;margin-left:30px;">Summary: This lesson covers several contemporary communication technology topics. It describes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), which allows packetized voice and multimedia transmission across IP networks. It explores file transfer protocols such as FTP and P2P sharing, emphasizing security issues and potential legal ramifications. It also explains the features of a remote desktop, including how it permits remote access and management of computer settings.
      Activity 1:Screen Sharing / Remote Desktop
      In this activity, I learned about a few different remote desktop programs and used one to connect to another machine. By investigating choices such as Quick Assist, Virtual Network Computing, and Chrome Remote Desktop, I was able to expand my knowledge about remote collaboration tools and gain practical experience with remote access.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply the variety of uses for remote desktop software that I currently have at work. This will ultimately increase productivity and promote smooth communication. Examples of this include conducting training sessions, working with remote team members, offering remote technical help, and accessing work materials from any location.
      Activity 2: Intellectual Property
      In this activity, I learned that unauthorized music copying is prohibited and punishable by law in both civil and criminal courts. While criminal accusations might result in felony records, up to five years in jail, and fines of $250,000, civil claims could result in substantial fines. As a result, downloading from unreliable websites is never permitted.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply this knowledge of intellectual property in my current work environment by understanding the repercussions of unauthorized copying of copyrighted material. This includes learning how to navigate the legal landscape surrounding music and other copyrighted content to mitigate the risk of facing lawsuits.
