  Activity 2: In my opinion, Google's search engine has the best user interface and provides the most helpful results. Google's user interface is simple and usable, with a single search box on the homepage and well-structured search results. Its search algorithm is tailored to users' needs, considering location, search history, and behavior. Google's ongoing improvements and integration of other services enhance its user experience. Google also has the highest market share at 91.47%.
