    <p style=" color:linen;margin-left:30px;">Activity 1: Create and use raster graphics.
        
      In this activity, I learned about raster graphics through Wikipedia, using Picozu and Pixlr. Then, I explored GIMP for raster image creation. Following tutorials, I installed GIMP and designed an image. Finally, I applied HTML img tag from W3Schools to add the image to my webpage. This hands-on experience enhanced my understanding of raster graphics and web design.
         
      In this activity, I will be able to apply valuable skills in raster graphics for myself in my current work environment. Understanding raster graphics aids in creating/editing images for presentations, marketing, and social media. Utilizing tools like GIMP enhances image manipulation efficiency. Integrating images via HTML improves visual communication, enhancing productivity and versatility in graphic design and web development tasks.
           
      Activity 2: Create and use vector graphics.
        
      In this activity, I learned about vector graphics through Wikipedia and completed a tutorial on Vectr.com, creating a new vector graphics image. I also explored Inkscape, following tutorials to design another vector graphics image for my webpage. By applying HTML img tag from W3Schools, I seamlessly integrated vector graphics into my web content.
        
      In this activity, I will be able to apply essential vector graphics skills for myself in my current work environment. Understanding vector graphics is crucial for designing logos, illustrations, and infographics for various tasks like presentations and marketing. Utilizing Vectr.com and Inkscape facilitates efficient creation and editing, while integrating vector graphics into web pages enhances user experience and productivity in graphic design and web development tasks, thereby boosting my value as a contributor.
