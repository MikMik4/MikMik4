    <h3>Assignment 15 Summary</h3>
    <p>In Assignment 15, I confirmed the completion of hands-on activities using VSC. I validated and displayed a Gantt chart image in assignment15.html, linking it in web110/index.html. I updated and validated previous assignment files and style.css. I summarized personal learning applications, emphasizing project management insights applicable to future endeavors. In this activity, I learned to effectively organize project tasks, manage timelines, and improve collaboration. These skills will be invaluable in planning and executing my final project, ensuring its success and timely completion.</p>
    <p>In this activity, I will be able to apply effective task organization using Gantt charts for prioritization and resource allocation in my current work environment. By implementing project timelines and fostering collaboration among team members, I aim to enhance productivity and project success through transparent communication and continuous improvement.
