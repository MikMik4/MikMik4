      Activity 1: Use the Palleton
      In this activity, I learned to harness effective color schemes using the Paletton website. Experimenting with monochromatic, adjacent-color, three-color, and four-color designs expanded my understanding of harmonious color combinations and their impact on visual aesthetics. This exercise empowered me to create compelling and cohesive designs.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply the insights gained from experimenting with color schemes for myself in my current work environment. By implementing Paletton's guidance, I can enhance the visual appeal and effectiveness of my design projects, whether it's presentations, reports, or marketing materials, by strategically employing captivating color combinations to effectively convey messages and evoke desired audience responses.
          
      Activity 2: Use the WebAIM: Contrast Checker
      In this activity, I learned about the importance of accessible design by using the WebAIM: Contrast Checker to assess color contrast on web pages. By making necessary corrections to meet accessibility standards, I ensured better readability and inclusivity for users with visual impairments, enhancing the overall user experience.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply the insights gained from using the WebAIM: Contrast Checker for myself in my current work environment. By regularly assessing color contrast on web pages, I can ensure that our digital content meets accessibility standards, promoting inclusivity and user-friendly experiences for all individuals.
