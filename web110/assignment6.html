     <h3 style=" color:linen;text-align:center;margin-left:20px;">Session 6- Internet Fundamentals/Networking</h3>
    <p style=" color:linen;margin-left:30px;">Lesson summary: Computer networks enable digital communication through wired or wireless media, with wired connections like coaxial and Wi-Fi. Access is managed by network devices like NICs and routers. Network topologies and protocols regulate communication, while firewalls manage access. The Internet Protocol Suite (IPSL) maintains four layers, while DNS simplifies resource identification.
      Activity 1:Verify Internet connectivity
      In this activity, I learned to verify physical connections for wired and wireless networks, check IP address settings using commands like ipconfig, and perform Ping/Host, Tracert, and Nslookup commands for troubleshooting. These skills will help me ensure internet connectivity in my workplace efficiently.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply techniques for verifying physical connections in both wired and wireless networks, configuring IP addresses across different operating systems, and utilizing crucial networking commands such as Ping/Host, Tracert, and Nslookup to troubleshoot and ensure internet connectivity in my current work environment.
      Activity 2: Review IP address settings for your local network
      In this activity, I learned about troubleshooting network adapter issues and changing TCP/IP settings on Windows systems by reviewing Microsoft's guides. I also reviewed network settings and used the ipconfig command to display IP address information, including releasing and renewing dynamic IP addresses.
      In this activity, I will be able to apply techniques for troubleshooting and resolving network adapter issues on Windows systems. Additionally, I could learn to optimize network performance by modifying TCP/IP settings. By reviewing network settings and utilizing the ipconfig command, I can enhance my ability to manage IP addresses and efficiently resolve connectivity issues in my current work environment.
